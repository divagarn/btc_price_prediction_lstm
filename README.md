# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
This notebook demonstrates the prediction of the bitcoin price by the neural network model. We are using long short term memory (LSTM)

# mac os usage:
download conda 
create new conda env 
activate it 
and use as a kernel in jupiter notebook 

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes

# There are four steps 
1.Getting real-time crptocurrency data(bitcoin).
2.Prepare data for training and testing.
3.Predict the price of crptocurrency using LSTM neural network (deep learning).
4.Visualize the prediction results.

1. Getting real-time crptocurrency data(bitcoin or whatever you want)
You can collect the current data for Bitcoin from Yahoo Finance by clickinng historical data set the time duriation you need and download.


4.Visualize the prediction results.
